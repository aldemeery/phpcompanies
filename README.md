# PHPCompanies: A Community-Driven PHP Companies Directory

An open-source directory of PHP companies, built for and by the community.

By enabling everyone to contribute companies theyâ€™ve worked for, we could build a comprehensive resource where developers can find new opportunities from submissions by others.
Maybe even companies could list themselves to be directly visible to engineers, avoiding the recruitment maze.

You can check it out at [https://phpcompanies.net](https://phpcompanies.net).

## Contribution
Contribution is super simple.
You just need to [open an issue](https://github.com/aldemeery/phpcompanies/issues/new?template=new-company.md&title=Add+Company%3A+%5BCompany%5D), submitting the company name (and other information if you want), and I'll take care of the rest.

The list of companies is also kept in a [single file](https://github.com/aldemeery/phpcompanies/blob/master/js/db/companies.db.js), in case someone wants the raw data to do anything with.
