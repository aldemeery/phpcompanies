            <h1>PHPCompanies: A Community-Driven PHP Companies Directory</h1>

            <p>
                As a poor PHP developer, whenever I searched for a PHP job, I used to use platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.
                <br>
                and I always braced myself for the frustration caused by the sheer volume of spam postings.
                <br>
                You know, it's just the way it works.
            </p>

            <p>
                Time went by, and I needed to find a new company to work for.
                <br>
                This time, and out of my frustration, I decided to try manually checking companies websites and their careers pages to see if they were looking for people to join.
            </p>

            <p>
                And surprisingly, this worked much better.
                <br>
                It had a noticeably higher apply-to-response rate, meaning that my applications were more likely to be seen, and I actually needed to apply to fewer companies in order to land a job.
            </p>

            <p>
                The only problem with that method was that there was no single source listing all PHP companies.
                <br>
                So, I had to spend a lot of time researching a lot of companies to find those that used PHP for development and then see if they were hiring.
            </p>

            <p>
                This made me always think: if only there were a single place that listed all PHP companies.
                <br>
                Then I thought, why not create a community-maintained directory of PHP companies?
            </p>

            <p>
                By enabling everyone to contribute companies they’ve worked for, we could build a comprehensive resource where developers can find new opportunities from submissions by others.
                <br>
                Maybe even companies could list themselves to be directly visible to engineers, avoiding the recruitment maze.
            </p>

            <p>
                Think about it... it's a win for everyone and a loss for talent-pooling spammers (aka recruitment agencies).
            </p>

            <p>
                So here I am. I’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/aldemeery/phpcompanies" target="_blank">repo on GitHub</a> to be an open-source directory of PHP companies, built for and by the community.
                <br>
                And I've built a super simple UI to make searching easier.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've also made contribution super simple — in order to encourage people to contribute.
                <br>
                You just have to <a href="https://github.com/aldemeery/phpcompanies/issues/new?template=new-company.md&title=Add+Company%3A+%5BCompany%5D" target="_blank">open an issue</a>, submitting the company name (and other information if you want), and I'll take care of the rest.
            </p>

            <p>
                The list of companies is also kept in a <a href="https://github.com/aldemeery/phpcompanies/blob/master/js/db/companies.db.js" target="_blank">single file</a>, in case someone wants the raw data to do anything with.
